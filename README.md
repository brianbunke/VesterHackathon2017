# Vester @ the VMworld US 2017 Hackathon

This repository is a historical record of the work our team, [See My Vest](https://youtu.be/TyWVaZsUQjc), accomplished during the [VMworld hackathon](https://blogs.vmware.com/code/2017/07/28/vmworld-hackathon-back/) on August 28, 2017.

We went in to the evening with these rough goals:

1. Extend Vester to support vSAN, and begin adding relevant tests
2. Add tests to help enforce the [6.5 Security Config Guide](https://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2017/04/vsphere-6-5-security-configuration-guide-now-available.html)
3. Time permitting, extend `Get-VesterTest` to group together tests tagged as 6.5 security related

We added vSAN host tests, and added new 6.5 security value tests. I'm also proud to say that each team member made one of the night's [commits](https://github.com/brianbunke/VesterHackathon2017/compare/14008d2e3ceae331757d81d7b050cd746a530494...87c47bd3e30a2a66390399eabcf74a6da95430ee)!
